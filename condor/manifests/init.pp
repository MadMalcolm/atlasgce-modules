# Class: condor
#
#  Condor is a specialized workload management system for compute-intensive
#  jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor provides a job
#  queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource
#  monitoring, and resource management.  Users submit their serial or
#  parallel jobs to Condor, Condor places them into a queue, chooses when and
#  where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully monitors their
#  progress, and ultimately informs the user upon completion.
#
#  This is a base installation of condor.
